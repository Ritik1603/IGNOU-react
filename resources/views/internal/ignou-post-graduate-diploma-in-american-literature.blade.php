                <h2>What is the Post Graduate Diploma in American Literature program?</h2>
                <p>American literature has contributed in many different ways to global storytelling. This includes bold voices and social questions as well as innovative dramas, powerful poems, and dramatic plays. This diploma provides a way to examine those contributions using a structured, engaging format. This program stands out because it includes both modern and classic thinkers.</p>
                <p>Our first task is to explore the American literary heritage, including Puritan writings and early poetry. We also examine the rise of American novels. Next, we will study modernist and Postmodernist writers who created culture by experimenting with themes and expressing themselves in new ways. It also examines the evolution of American drama, from its early days to today's socially charged scripts.</p>
                <p>This diploma's unit on literary criticism and theory is among its most important features. Abstract concepts such as structuralism and feminist theory can be difficult for students to grasp. PGDAML makes it easy to understand these abstract concepts with the help of real-life literary examples. The PGDAML helps to explain how texts are read, symbolism identified and theories influencing modern readings.</p>
                <p>The program has a lot to offer for those who are looking for structure, depth and clarity.</p>
