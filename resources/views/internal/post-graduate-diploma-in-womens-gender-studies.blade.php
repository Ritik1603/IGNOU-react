                <h2>What is the Best Program for You?</h2>
                <p>The choice of a course in Women's Studies and Gender is very different than a social science general. The diploma allows us to explore the intersections between gender, culture, society and media. These are some of the main reasons why students choose this program:</p>

                    <div class="card"><strong>1. Understanding society through a sharper lens</strong><br />The gender perspective is more than a mere topic. It affects every aspect of our lives.

Gender is a factor in everything, whether we are studying media, literature or workplaces.</div>
                    <div class="card"><strong>2. Theory in action: a practical guide</strong><br />This programme will teach us about the history of gender and women's studies and its key theories.

                    <div class="card"><strong>3. Relevant in Many Different Sectors</strong><br />The diploma is useful to anyone who wants to pursue a career where critical thinking, empathy and analysis are important. This diploma is used by students in journalism, education, social work or humanities to enhance their understanding of the profession.</div>
                    <div class="card"><strong>4. Develops critical and analytical thinking</strong><br />This helps us to understand how institutions, language, and symbols reinforce inequality and power. The reasoning is useful in writing, research, storytelling, policy and academic work.</div>
                    <div class="card"><strong>5. Flexible Learning Format</strong><br />Open and distance modes allow us to learn at our own pace.
