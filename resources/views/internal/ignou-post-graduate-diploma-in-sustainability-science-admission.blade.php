                <h2>What is the Post Graduate Diploma in Sustainability Science program?</h2>
                <p>Sustainable science is an expanding discipline that tries to find the answer to a very important question. How can the development of humans continue without harming our environment and future generations?</p>
                <p>The Post Graduate Diploma of Sustainability Science is designed to teach students how they can analyze and evaluate models for development, as well as understand environmental pressures, socio-economic problems, and governance structures. Instead of reading about problems and analyzing them, students explore the relationship between:</p>
                <ul style="margin:20px 0; padding-left:32px;">
                    <li>Humans and ecosystems</li>
                    <li>Resource use and economic growth</li>
                    <li>Culture and the environment</li>
                    <li>Governance and sustainable development</li>
                    <li>Global strategy and local needs</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The course encourages participants to approach problems holistically and not just in a linear fashion. The "big picture", that is, how the environment, politics, economics, and social policies interact, is essential for sustainable modern development.</p>
                <p>The students are ready to understand sustainability indicators, global frameworks, including SDGs and ecological limits. Sustainable development is not just about environmental science, but also includes human sciences. This degree connects both areas seamlessly.</p>

                <h2>Unnati education:</h2>
                <p>Unnati Education knows that studying sustainability at first can be overwhelming and confusing. Most learners have difficulty deciding what topics to focus on first, managing assignments and building clarity of concepts. We can help you make this experience easier.</p>
                <p>Helping students is done by:</p>
                <ul class="list-check">
                    <li>The unit is designed to simplify academic concepts and guide students through them.</li>
                    <li>Assisting in assignment understanding and examination preparation</li>
                    <li>Consistent support for the whole academic year</li>
                    <li>It is possible to help students plan their education without stress.</li>
                    <li>Clarifying concepts such as project-based learning and sustainability models</li>
                    <li>From the first question through to the final step, we guide you from 0 to 100.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is our goal to help every learner feel confident and supported so that they can apply their sustainability knowledge to real-life situations.</p>
