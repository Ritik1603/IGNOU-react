        <section id="about" class="section">
            <h2>What is the Post Graduate Diploma in International Business Operations Program?</h2>
            <p>The Post Graduate Diploma in International Business Operations (PGDIBO) is for learners who want to learn more about the movement of goods, capital and information across borders. The program breaks down concepts like "exports", "LCs", or "Incoterms", which are often heard in casual conversation.</p>
            <p>We can see international trade as a complex system. We first understand the broader context, then we narrow it down to India's trade with other countries, before diving into operational elements such as logistics, documentation and finance.</p>
            <p>It is professional and not overly technical because it is offered at a management school. The programme does not require us to be economists or finance experts before we join. The programme builds our abilities to understand trade policies, international marketing strategies and processes common in global businesses.</p>
            <p>The importance of entrepreneurial thinking is another important factor. The knowledge that they have gained can be used to help support family businesses or start small export units. They may also work with established logistics and export companies. The curriculum was designed so we can directly apply concepts, whether dealing with clients overseas, customs clearance or transport routes.</p>
            <p>The services of academic counseling and support for learners are also available to us. Distance learners are not left alone. Teleconferencing sessions and interactive opportunities are available where we can ask questions and get answers from experts.</p>

    <div class="tab-panel" data-tab="careers">
        <section id="eligibility" class="section">

            <p>The eligibility requirements for this program are simple and inclusive. Anyone who has a Bachelor’s degree, or an equivalent qualification in any subject, can apply for this diploma.</p>
            <p>There are no restrictions on age or prior experience. B.Com graduates, B.A. This course is open to anyone with a B.Sc., a background in engineering, or a B.Com.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>Unnati Education, a learner-focused organization, helps students to read and understand official notifications, determine their eligibility, select appropriate programmes, and make informed choices. It is our goal to make the process clear and free of confusion so we do not get bogged down in technical details.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="objectives" class="section">
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>The PGDIBO aims to equip us with the knowledge and skills we need to handle international business tasks confidently. Some key goals include:</p>
            <ul class="list-check">
                <li>Building basic and advanced knowledge of the international business environment, as well as India's exports.</li>
                <li>Developing conceptual clarity regarding marketing, finance, and logistics as they relate to international trade, not just domestic.</li>
                <li>Export-import procedures and documents should be easier to understand and follow.</li>
                <li>Encourage the use of analytical thinking to make decisions about global competition, market entry, and trade policies.</li>
                <li>Supporting entrepreneurial skills and management so we can make a significant contribution to export houses and trading firms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These objectives do not only appear in brochures. These objectives can be seen in the IBO modules, which frame the content of the course. IBO-4 and IBO-5, for example, are very hands-on, while IBO-1 & IBO-3 provide the macro context that we need to anchor this practical learning.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="outcomes" class="section">
            <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
            <p>The diploma will provide us with a number of practical and academic outcomes which can be applied immediately to the workplace or in future studies. Some of these outcomes are:</p>
            <div class="grid">
                <div class="card"><strong>Understanding Global Environments:</strong><br>We explain how cultural, political, economic, and legal factors affect trade decisions, multinational strategies, and international relations.</div>
                <div class="card"><strong>Getting to know India's trade profile:</strong><br>We learn about India's export and import products, its trade policies, as well as the role of the institutions responsible for managing foreign trade.</div>
                <div class="card"><strong>Handling Documentation for Export and Import:</strong><br>We are able to identify and understand key documents that relate to shipping, customs payments, and contracts.</div>

                <div class="card"><strong>The Interpretation of Trade Finance:</strong><br>In this course, we will develop a basic knowledge of foreign currency, letters of credit, and risk-management tools that are used in global transactions.</div>
                <div class="card"><strong>Problem-Solving for Operations:</strong><br>We gain confidence in identifying issues related to delays, overruns in costs, and compliance. And we're better equipped to offer realistic solutions.</div>
            </div>
            <p>The diploma allows us to understand that we can be involved in international business, rather than just reading about it in the newspapers or in textbooks. The shift in perspective is particularly powerful for those from non-metropolitan areas and smaller institutions.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="careers" class="section">
            <h2>Career Opportunities</h2>
            <p>The PGDIBO is a gateway to many sectors involving cross-border trading and global operations. The PGDIBO is a year-long programme that provides solid support to professionals at all levels, including those in mid-career.</p>
            <p>Some common career paths include:</p>
            <div class="grid">
                <div class="card"><strong>Export-Import Managers:</strong><br>Manage orders, paperwork, and coordination with clients, and coordinate with authorities.</div>
                <div class="card"><strong>International Marketing Support</strong><br>Assist in market research and overseas promotions. Coordinate with foreign distributors.</div>

                <div class="card"><strong>PGDIBO can be a good step towards MBAs or other advanced management programs with a focus on international business.</strong></div>
            </div>
            <p>It is important to remember that the diploma itself does not guarantee success. If we combine this diploma with consistent efforts, internships or entry-level positions, family business experience and/or internships, it can become a credential that demonstrates our serious investment in global trade.</p>

        <section id="addon" class="section">
            <h2>Add-On Courses</h2>
            <p>PGDIBO learners often choose to add short courses and certifications that will enhance their profiles. Popular add-on paths are:</p>
            <ul class="list-check">
                <li>INCOTERMS or Customs Clearance are short programmes in foreign policy.</li>
                <li>Certificates in Logistics and Supply Chain Management.</li>
