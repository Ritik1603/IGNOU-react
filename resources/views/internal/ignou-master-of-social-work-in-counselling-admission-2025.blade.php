            <section id="syllabus" class="section">
                <h2>IGNOU Master of Social Work in Counselling Syllabus (2025) - Overview of the semesters</h2>
                <p>Here is the academic structure with the focus on thematics.</p>
                <p>The IGNOU Master of Social Work in Counselling curriculum is based on four key pillars.</p>
                <div class="grid">
                    <div class="card"><strong>1. Core Social Work Fundamentals</strong><br />Origin, Evolution, and Professional Ethics of Social Work in the Indian and Global Context</div>
                    <div class="card"><strong>2. Psychological and Behavioural Understand</strong><br />Human Development, personality dynamics and the psychological foundation of counselling.</div>
                    <div class="card"><strong>3. Applied Counselling Practice</strong><br />Casework and group work. Community organization. Communication skills.</div>
                    <div class="card"><strong>4. Field Practicums and Internships</strong><br />Real-world placements and block fieldwork. Hands-on counselling with professional supervision.</div>
                </div>
                <p>Every semester builds on previous ones, from understanding human development up to independently managing counselling sessions. The structure encourages self-reflection while also promoting professional mastery. This helps graduates become confident professionals capable of handling complicated psychosocial cases.</p>
                <h3>Counselling is becoming increasingly important in modern India</h3>
                <p>India's rapid industrialization, digital stress and changing family structures have contributed to a rise in emotional and psychosocial challenges. Despite this, India still has a shortage of social workers and trained counsellors.</p>
                <p>This gap demonstrates why IGNOU’s MSW program (Counselling) is not only an academic degree, but a necessity for society. It develops professionals who are able to bring emotional stability, resilience, and a sense of hope into the lives of people struggling under pressure.</p>
                <p>The program trains students to combine science with empathy and creates a generation that can heal society from the inside out -- one conversation at time.</p>
