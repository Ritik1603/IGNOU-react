            <h2>What is a Post Graduate Diploma in Pre Primary Education?</h2>
            <p>The School of Education designed the Post Graduate Diploma in Pre Primary Education. It is aimed at educating educators who are interested in working with children in pre-school. The program helps students understand early child development, plan classroom activities, manage the learning space, interact with families and create meaningful learning experiences.</p>
            <p>The program has a clear purpose. This is because many pre-primary education schools require teachers with professional training, and not only volunteers or untrained caregivers. This diploma gives learners a structured knowledge of pre-school teaching, classroom management, and modern teaching practices.</p>
            <p>This course is also in line with IGNOU's PG diploma programme and the open and distance pre-primary courses. The method is flexible, but comprehensive and suitable for students with different educational backgrounds.</p>
