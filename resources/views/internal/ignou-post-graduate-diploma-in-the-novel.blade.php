                <h2>What is the Post Graduate Diploma in Novel program?</h2>
                <p>The Post Graduate Diploma for the Novel was designed to help learners go beyond the surface level of reading fiction. The course examines the development of novels as a literary genre and explores different social influences on this form.</p>
                <p>The curriculum begins with British writers whose works shaped modern fiction. In their stories, we examine how morality, social hierarchy, class conflict and psychological depth reflect. After that, it moves on to American literature, which is dominated by themes such as identity, American dreams, freedom, race and modernist experiments.</p>
                <p>Australian fiction immerses the reader in the culture and politics of the continent. From colonial tales to stories about indigenous people, immigration experiences and the modern national identity, Australian novels take the student on an educational journey into their cultural and political past. It gives them a global perspective on the evolution of novels.</p>
                <p>In addition to these traditional elements, this program covers literary theories. This is an important area because it teaches students how critics view texts. We can use theory to better understand what is behind cultural patterns, gender, stories, and structures.</p>
                <p>It's more than a journey of academics; the diploma also explores human experience from the perspective of centuries of storytellers.</p>
