            <section id="why" class="section">
                <h2>Why Choose the Diploma in Nutrition & Health Education Program?</h2>
                <p>The choice of a diploma usually depends on the student's personal interest, their future goals, and/or their desire to assist others. This program combines all three.</p>
                <div class="grid">
                    <div class="card"><strong>1. Strong Foundation in Nutrition and Public Health</strong><br />The importance of nutrition in our daily lives is well-known, but most people are unaware of the basic concepts. This program helps students gain clear, foundational knowledge. The concepts will be introduced in an easy and relatable manner so that students with no prior knowledge of the subject can easily follow. It serves as a link between practical learning and the scientific basics.</div>
                    <div class="card"><strong>2. Useful for community work and social roles</strong><br />This diploma is designed to prepare you to effectively communicate information in a variety of roles. You'll learn to explain health issues in a language that everyone can understand. You will be more effective in everyday situations.</div>
                    <div class="card"><strong>3. Beginners, as well as experienced learners, will benefit from the course.</strong><br />It is not necessary to have any prior knowledge of nutrition or health. Participants with only a 10+2 diploma can still benefit. The diploma is also useful for community workers involved in awareness programmes.</div>
                    <div class="card"><strong>4. Communication Skills Training</strong><br />Books don't make you a great educator. The program is designed to improve communication skills so that participants can explain health concepts clearly without confusion. These skills are useful in all areas -- the workplace, the community, and everyday interactions.</div>
                    <div class="card"><strong>5. Flexible and Easy to Manage Learning</strong><br />The diploma is easily managed with other commitments because it runs on a distance-learning platform. Students can learn at home and at their own pace.</div>
                </div>
                <p>The program is ideal for students who want to contribute meaningfully and raise awareness within society.</p>

            <!-- WHAT IS -->
            <section id="whatis" class="section">
                <h2>What is the Program?</h2>
                <p>The Diploma in Nutrition & Health Education aims to provide learners with the fundamentals of nutrition, public health and related topics in a practical way. Many communities are struggling with misinformation and limited resources. This program will teach learners to fill the gap by using simple communication techniques and practical guidance.</p>
                <p>Learners explore topics like:</p>
                <ul class="list-check">
                    <li>Basic nutritional concepts</li>
                    <li>Public health principles</li>
                    <li>Health and lifestyle: What you can do to improve your health</li>
                    <li>Guide communities by using relatable examples</li>
                    <li>What is the impact of health behaviour on different groups?</li>
                    <li>Communication is key to understanding instructions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The strength of the diploma lies in its application. You learn more than just "what nutrition means"; you also learn how to explain it. This is important, especially in rural and semi-urban areas where the people depend on community workers to provide health knowledge.</p>
                <p>Students learn how they can shape messages and speak clearly. They also learn how to design awareness exercises, as well as how to encourage rather than give complicated explanations to groups.</p>
                <p>The diploma qualifies learners to work as nutrition educators and health outreach workers.</p>

                <h2>About Unnati Education</h2>
                <p>In our years of experience working with IGNOU, we have observed that many students are unsure about how the program is structured, what assignments to do, how to interpret the syllabus or even their preparation methods. Our goal is to make the learning process clear, organized and stress-free.</p>
                <p>We can help your students in the following ways:</p>
                <div class="grid">
                    <div class="card"><strong>You can guide them from the moment they enroll to their completion.</strong></div>
                    <div class="card"><strong>Provide clarity about the order of the syllabus and preparation time.</strong></div>
                    <div class="card"><strong>They will be able to understand concepts more easily if you explain them in a way that is relatable.</strong></div>
                    <div class="card"><strong>Providing timely assistance during their assignment is a great way to support them.</strong></div>
                    <div class="card"><strong>Don't let them miss important deadlines by reminding them about their academic schedules.</strong></div>
                    <div class="card"><strong>Instead of rushing through learning, encourage consistent study habits.</strong></div>
                </div>
                <p>Our approach is consistent and student-centered. We want learners to feel confident, calm, and supported throughout their academic journey. We provide learners with the clarity and direction they need to move from 0 - 100.</p>
