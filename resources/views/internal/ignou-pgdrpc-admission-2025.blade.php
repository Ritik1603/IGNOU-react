                <p class="lead">Students who wish to pursue a career in disability and rehabilitation are often looking for a recognized, structured qualification rather than a short-term workshop. IGNOU Post Graduate Diploma in Rehabilitation Psychology admission for the PGDRPC Programme offers a structured path. It is a one-year professional qualification, recognized by the Rehabilitation Council of India, designed for people with a background in psychology who want to gain a more focused knowledge of disability, assessment, rehabilitation, and practice.</p>
                <p class="lead">We have seen many learners working in special education or schools, NGOs, hospitals, the community, and other settings, but feeling stuck due to the lack of a formal rehabilitation psychological qualification. This programme offers them a combination of solid theory and guided practical experience across all life stages, including childhood and late adulthood. Unnati Education is here to help you better understand the course, its benefits, and how it can be used in your academic journey.</p>

            <h2>Why Choose Post Graduate Diploma in Rehabilitation Psychology - at IGNOU</h2>
            <p>It is important to make a well-informed decision when choosing a professional degree. We always advise students to focus on three factors: relevance, recognition, and actual skill building. This program is a good example of all three.</p>
            <p>The first is that it is RCI-recognized. This is essential if your goal is to work within regulated disability and rehab settings in India. The RCI standards and regulations are used to design the diploma (March 2017), which means that it is not a random mix of credits, structure, and practical elements.</p>
            <p>The second is that it does not focus on generic counselling but rather on rehabilitation psychology. This means that you will study how disabilities, injuries, illnesses, environments, and social attitudes affect a person. You don't just study "problems", you also study the barriers and supports of everyday living.</p>
            <p>The School of Social Sciences of IGNOU (SOSS) offers this programme via Open and Distance Learning. This allows us to continue working, taking care of family obligations, or managing existing projects as we study. Distance learning combined with practical elements makes it a viable option for professionals who can't leave the comfort of their homes.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that this is more than a simple qualification if we take the course seriously, we can improve our understanding of disability, how to assess needs, and how to design interventions for real-life situations.</p>

            <h2>Program Highlights for RCI Approved Professional Diploma</h2>
            <p>A few points stand out when we examine this diploma through the eyes of a student:</p>
            <div class="grid">
                <div class="card"><strong>RCI Recognition</strong><br>The Rehabilitation Council of India recognizes the program, meaning that it meets all national standards of training in rehabilitation psychology. After completing this programme, it is necessary to apply to RCI to be registered as a professional in rehabilitation (according to the current norms).</div>
                <div class="card"><strong>Professional Orientation</strong><br>This isn't a strictly academic course. This course is a combination of in-depth theoretical work and practical work in the areas of disability identification, assessment, counselling, community-based rehabilitation, and community-based therapy.</div>
                <div class="card"><strong>Life-Span Coverage:</strong><br>The programme examines human functioning in all stages of life, from early childhood through to late adulthood. This means we are not limited to one age range, but rather we can understand how disabilities and rehabilitation needs evolve over the lifespan.</div>
                <div class="card"><strong>Merit-Based Seat Selection:</strong><br>There are 200 seats and selection is made on the basis of merit. This includes percentages from bachelor's degrees and/or graduate-level psychology degrees. The peer group is kept focused and serious.</div>
                <div class="card"><strong>Medium of Instruction</strong><br>The program is offered in English. This matches the majority of research and study materials for postgraduate psychology.</div>

    <div class="tab-panel" data-tab="syllabus">
        <section id="about" class="section">
            <h2>About the Program – What PGDRPC Trains us for</h2>
            <p>Rehabilitation psychology is the specialised field where psychology concepts meet reality. In contrast to focusing on only symptoms, the focus is instead on functioning, adjustment, and participation in everyday life.</p>
            <p>The Post Graduate Diploma in Rehabilitation Psychology was designed to provide both theoretical and practical knowledge to enable us to work as professionals in this field. We will learn about how psychological theories help explain the adjustment to disability and how social systems can create barriers. We will also explore how evidence-based interventions support people reaching their goals.</p>
            <p>We will also learn about interdisciplinary work. Rehabilitation psychologists are not alone in their work. They coordinate with doctors and other professionals, including physiotherapists. Occupational therapists. Special educators. Social workers. This program makes us feel at ease with the team approach.</p>
            <p>As we move through the course, you will be asked to think more like a professional: how do we document a case? How do we create goals that are measurable and realistic? How can we work with families and clients in a respectful and ethical manner? You can't learn these things from books. Instead, you need to be guided in practice. That is what this program aims to do.</p>

    <!-- ==================== CAREER & ELIGIBILITY ==================== -->
    <div class="tab-panel" data-tab="careers">
        <section id="eligibility" class="section">
            <h2>Who is eligible to apply for PGDRPC</h2>
            <p>The program is for people with a background in psychology. The course is not for those who are new to psychology.</p>
            <p>The following are the broad categories of eligibility:</p>
            <ul class="list-check">
                <li>All three years of a regular Bachelor's degree, including General Psychology.<br>OR</li>
                <li>You can earn a Master's in Psychology through regular or distance education.<br>OR</li>
                <li>Regular or distance-learning Master's in Counselling Psychology.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The minimum marks required are:</p>
            <ul class="list-check">
                <li>For general candidates, 55% of the total marks is required.</li>
                <li>Amounts for SC/ST/OBC categories: 50%</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The RCI regulation of March 2017 is used as the basis for the criteria. These eligibility norms make sure that students joining the programme already have core psychological knowledge, so the focus can be on rehabilitation-specific learning rather than basic theory.</p>
            <p>The main question for many of the students we speak to is not, "Can I get into?" but, "Is this right for me?". If you are good at working with people and can handle the detail-oriented work involved in assessment, as well as being able to look at disability through the lens of rights-based person-centred thinking, then your fit is likely to be strong.</p>

        <section id="objectives" class="section">
            <h2>Objectives of the Post Graduate Diploma in Rehabilitation Psychology - What is it designed to achieve?</h2>
            <p>We can summarise the objectives in simple terms.</p>
            <ul class="list-check">
                <li>Professional Competence in Rehabilitation<br>Learners will develop the confidence, knowledge, and skills they need to work in disability rehabilitation settings.</li>
                <li>RCI Registration Pathway:<br>Learners will be eligible to apply as Rehabilitation professionals to RCI if they meet all regulatory requirements.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>This programme is not just about "learning" about disability, but also about how to act in disability situations.</p>

        <section id="outcomes" class="section">
            <h2>Learning Outcomes – After Completing PGDRPC, What Can We Do?</h2>
            <p>When we complete the programme, we should:</p>
            <div class="grid">
                <div class="card"><strong>Understanding Disability in Context</strong><br>Explain disability from a social, psychological, or rights-based perspective rather than relying on medical labels.</div>
                <div class="card"><strong>Identify Needs Over the Lifespan</strong><br>Recognize early signs and ongoing requirements in children, adolescents, and adults with disabilities or chronic conditions.</div>
                <div class="card"><strong>Conduct basic Rehabilitation Assessments.</strong><br>Understanding different tools, interpreting findings, and contributing to the psychological aspects in case formulation are all part of participating in assessment processes.</div>
                <div class="card"><strong>Plan and Support Interventions</strong><br>Within the scope of your training, work with teams to plan interventions for education, social inclusion, family support, and vocational settings.</div>
                <div class="card"><strong>Working with Families and Communities</strong><br>Communication with caregivers should be sensitive, and psycho-educational materials should be provided.</div>
                <div class="card"><strong>Collaboration in Multidisciplinary Teams</strong><br>Collaboration with other disciplines is possible without overstepping boundaries.</div>
            </div>
            <p>Many of us have experienced a quiet but powerful change: we no longer see disability as "less normal", but rather as a unique way to be in the world, requiring respect, support, and accessible environments.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="careers" class="section">
            <h2>Career Opportunities After PGDRPC</h2>
            <p>As this programme is RCI-recognized, it closely aligns with professional roles in disability and rehabilitation. Graduates may be able to explore the following options, depending on their eligibility and current policy.</p>
            <div class="grid">
                <div class="card"><strong>Rehabilitation Settings</strong><br>Working with multidisciplinary teams in rehabilitation centers, disability organisations, and NGOs that support people with developmental, sensory, or physical disabilities.</div>
                <div class="card"><strong>Educational and Special Needs Environments</strong><br>Supporting students with disabilities through inclusive education programmes and special educational units, as part of larger support teams.</div>
                <div class="card"><strong>Community-Based Programmes:</strong><br>Work with Panchayats to develop community-based rehabilitation projects. Also, work with self-help and local groups.</div>

                <div class="card"><strong>Corporate and Workplace Inclusion:</strong><br>Supporting organisations building inclusive workplaces that need people who have a thorough understanding of disabilities, accommodations, and psychosocial concerns.</div>
            </div>
            <p>We tell all students that a diploma is not a career-determinant. It's merely a platform. What matters is how you use it - which organizations you work for, how much experience you gain, and how long you keep learning.</p>
