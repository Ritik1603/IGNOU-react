                <h2>MSc Zoology Syllabus Overview</h2>
                <p>The IGNOU MSc Zoology curriculum is a four semester format with 80 credits. It combines theory, experimentation, and research.</p>
                <p><strong>Semester 1:</strong> This semester focuses on the molecular basis of life, genetics, and physiological processes. This first laboratory course develops strong analytical and experimentation skills.</p>
                <p><strong>Semester 2:</strong> Continues with advanced genetics and evolution. Also, explores animal behavior and welfare ethics. Students start integrating eco-theory with zoological applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Semester 3:</strong> The focus is on research methodology, immunology as well as data interpretation using biostatistics and Bioinformatics. Lab courses are taught at this level to reinforce analytical and numerical accuracy.</p>
                <p><strong>Semester 4:</strong> Introduces special electives in Entomology, including insect physiology and taxonomy. Also, a course on applied pest management is offered. This culminates with a dissertation that synthesizes both research and theory.</p>
                <p>Every semester deepens the learners' understanding. This ensures balanced development in terms of knowledge, skills and research abilities.</p>
