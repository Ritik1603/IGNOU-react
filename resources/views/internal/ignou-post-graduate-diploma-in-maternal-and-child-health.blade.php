                <h2>What is the Post Graduate Diploma in Maternal and Child Health program?</h2>
                <p>Post Graduate Diploma in Maternal and Child Health is a way for medical practitioners to gain a better understanding of MCH. We see that healthcare professionals are faced with many challenges, including the growing demand for pregnancy, cases of high-risk mothers, complications during neonatal care, outbreaks of disease, and emergencies involving children. We will be equipped with more refined skills in order to better handle real-life situations.</p>
                <p>This program covers maternal health and care as well as reproductive health. It does not teach new medical procedures. Instead, it deepens understanding of current protocols, national programs and patient-centered care frames.</p>
                <p>For doctors working in urban and rural health centers, it is important to have current information available so that they can make informed decisions. This programme provides us with a space for reflection, to refine and review our professional skills. Practical training is provided at selected medical colleges or district hospitals along with the academic components.</p>
                <p>The fact that this program combines clinical and population health knowledge makes it valuable. It is important for physicians working in hospitals, public health systems and private practices to have this combination.</p>

                <p>This programme consists of six modules divided into theoretical and practical elements (MME 301 – MMEL 303). The curriculum follows a logical progression from MCH prevention concepts to reproductive and pediatric health. The 36 credits ensure a balance of reading academic material, developing skills, and applying learning. Each credit represents structured learning time, practical exercises, evaluation and guided academic activities.</p>
