                <h3>Academic and Research Focus</h3>
                <p>The dissertation in the final term is more than a formal academic exercise. It's an important professional milestone that bridges theory and practice. Students study emerging tourism trends or market behavior. They often publish in academic journals, or apply their research to real-life projects.</p>
                <p>This strong research-oriented program prepares students to pursue advanced degrees, like Ph.D. programmes or careers as policy consultants. It also enhances analytical reasoning and data interpretation--skills
                highly valued in both public and private sectors.</p>
