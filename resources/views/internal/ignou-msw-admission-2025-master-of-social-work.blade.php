            <section id="syllabus" class="section">
                <h2>IGNOU Master of Social Work Syllabus 2025 (Semester-wise Overview)</h2>
                <p>The IGNOU MSW syllabus is built around 72 credits — a structured blend of core theory courses, electives, fieldwork, and dissertation components. Rather than rote learning, it focuses on developing conceptual depth, reflective practice, and community engagement.</p>
                <h3>First Year Overview</h3>
                <p>The first semester builds the foundational understanding of social work origins, Indian perspectives, and human behavior. Students are introduced to basic social science concepts, social development models, and essential research methodologies. Practical components include supervised fieldwork and exposure to social work settings.</p>
                <h3>Second Year Overview</h3>
                <p>The second semester moves toward advanced applications — including casework, counseling, community management, and policy-level interventions. Learners engage in block placements, internships, and a dissertation project to demonstrate field readiness.</p>
                <p>The overall design ensures that by the end of the two-year program, students acquire both academic mastery and professional competence, ready to work in national and international development contexts.</p>
                <p>(Full syllabus table will be added in the detailed version later.)</p>
                <h3>The Social Impact and Relevance of MSW</h3>
                <p>Social work as a profession is no longer confined to traditional welfare — it’s evolving into a strategic pillar for social innovation and policy transformation. IGNOU’s MSW program prepares learners to be active agents in this evolution.</p>
                <p>Graduates are trained to analyze social problems such as poverty, child labor, gender inequality, substance abuse, and environmental degradation — and to design practical, sustainable interventions.</p>
                <p>Moreover, the inclusion of African Context Studies and International Social Work reflects IGNOU’s recognition of cross-border challenges like migration, climate change, and public health crises — all requiring global cooperation and culturally sensitive solutions.</p>
                <p>In essence, this program produces not just social workers but change architects — individuals capable of bridging policy gaps, empowering communities, and driving inclusive growth.</p>
                <h3>Skills You’ll Develop Through the Master of Social Work Programme</h3>
                <p>The IGNOU MSW Admission 2025 program is skill-intensive, equipping students with both human-centered and analytical abilities. Key skills include:</p>
