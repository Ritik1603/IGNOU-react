                <h2>Why choose this Post Graduate Diploma in Geriatric Medicine program?</h2>
                <div class="grid">
                    <div class="card"><strong>1. The Need for More Geriatric-Trained Doctors</strong><br />India is undergoing a demographic change. As the population ages and life expectancy increases, more patients are presenting with health problems related to age. MBBS doctors frequently express the desire to have a more focused experience in geriatrics, despite having studied extensively. Through targeted learning, this diploma addresses that specific gap.</div>
                    <div class="card"><strong>2. The Ageing Spectrum: A Guide for Doctors</strong><br />The process of aging is much more complex than a simple decline in physical health. The term "aging" includes emotional shifts as well as social issues, challenges in communication, safety hazards, cognitive changes and family dynamics. It helps doctors better understand these various elements when it comes to assessing and treating older adults.</div>
                    <div class="card"><strong>3. A Balanced Combination of Theoretical and Practical Training</strong><br />Skill Development Centres are a key component of PGDGM. In real-life settings, doctors receive supervised geriatrics training. The doctors will gain a better understanding of the assessment and treatment techniques used for older patients, whether they are at home, in a hospital or in a community setting.</div>
                    <div class="card"><strong>4. Suitable for all doctors, both in government and private health care</strong><br />This diploma helps many MBBS physicians from government hospitals improve their geriatric knowledge and approach. The diploma is used to help private practitioners gain specific knowledge and skills for elderly care.</div>
                    <div class="card"><strong>5. CME - Academic Recognition</strong><br />The Medical Council of India has recognized this program as part of the Continuing Medical Education Program. The program is an excellent option for physicians who wish to pursue structured academic training without having their current clinical roles disrupted.</div>
                    <div class="card"><strong>6. Enhance teamwork and communication skills</strong><br />Doctors agree with the idea that dealing with elderly adults requires clear communication, patience, and strong coordination between families and healthcare workers. Through practical exercises and real-life case studies, the program assists learners in developing these abilities.</div>

                <h2>What is the Post Graduate Diploma in Geriatric Medicine program?</h2>
                <p>The Post Graduate Diploma in Geriatric Medicine is a comprehensive program that focuses on geriatric medicine. It includes epidemiology, biochemical changes, prevention strategies, assessment and evaluation, clinical decision making, and more.</p>
                <p>It is recognized that the elderly often behave differently from younger people. The symptoms of elderly patients may be vague or overlap, and they can also be masked due to chronic illnesses. You may see mobility restrictions, cognitive or emotional fluctuations, sensory changes, or a high level of dependency. The geriatric population is unique, and care must be provided in a structured manner.</p>
                <p>IGNOU has designed this degree so that doctors can:</p>
                <ul style="margin:20px 0; padding-left:32px;">
                    <li>Develop familiarity with functional assessments</li>
                    <li>Understanding how ageing impacts vital systems</li>
                    <li>How to properly examine and care for elderly patients</li>
                    <li>Ageing and its prevention, including psychological, socio-economic, and rehabilitational aspects</li>
                    <li>In the clinic and community, learn how to manage common geriatric illnesses.</li>
                    <li>Working with multidisciplinary teams to provide elderly holistic care to the elderly</li>
                    <li>Learn about the ethical and legal concerns that older adults face.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The course is a combination of foundational and real-life clinical knowledge, so it's a valuable resource for clinics or hospitals.</p>

                <h2>Post Graduate Diploma in Geriatric Medicine Curriculum & Syllabus Overview</h2>
                <p>This curriculum comprises six courses: 3 theory and 3 practical, for a total of 36 credits. This structure moves from a foundation of knowledge in geriatrics to more advanced clinical understanding and hands-on experience.</p>
                <p>Students begin by exploring the fundamentals of ageing. Next, they move on to geriatric concepts and finally, into practical settings, where they supervise elderly patients. It creates an environment where the theory guides practice, while practice improves clinical judgment.</p>
