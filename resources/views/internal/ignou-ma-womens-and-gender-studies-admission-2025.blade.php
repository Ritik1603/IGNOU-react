                <h2>IGNOU MA Women's and Gender Studies: Syllabus Overview</h2>
                <p>The MAWGSR curriculum is modular, with 80 credits spread over four semesters. It is in line with NEP 2020, which ensures academic depth and flexibility.</p>
                <p>The first academic year focuses on the theoretical core – building a foundation of understanding gender, power, sexuality, body and representation in art, literature and other media. These courses will help students decode the ways in which gender identities are maintained and constructed across social systems.</p>
                <p>Students may choose from two advanced specializations in the second year.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gender, Culture, and Literature: This course explores the relationship between gender, culture and literary theory. It also examines how gender influences narratives and nations.</li>
                    <li>Women's Studies: The focus is on social structures, political participation and women's right movements.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Students will also be required to complete a final-semester research project or an internship, which will allow them to integrate classroom learning and real-world experience. This project increases analytical depth, data interpretion, and field understanding -- essential skills to professionals in social advocacy, research, or policy making.</p>
                <p>You will be guided through the whole academic process - from course selection to final project completion - ensuring that you are clear at every step.</p>
