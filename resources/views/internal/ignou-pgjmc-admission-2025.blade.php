                <p class="lead">Unnati Education has many students who dream of working for newsrooms and content studios. We also see students who want to be part of corporate communication teams, digital platforms or corporate communications teams. Some are new graduates seeking a clear start. Others may be working, but wish to enhance their skills in reporting, writing or media production through IGNOU's journalism and mass communications distance learning programme. PGJMC is a direct response to both groups.</p>

                <li>Graduates who are looking to build a foundation for journalism and media.</li>
                <li>Media professionals or other working professionals who did not have a formal journalism education but would like to obtain one.</li>
                <li>Students who wish to learn about the role media plays in shaping society, public opinions, and democracy.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The programme is divided into:</p>
            <ul class="list-check">
                <li>The news industry, from the idea of a story to its publication.</li>
